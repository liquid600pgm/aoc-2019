# Advent of Code 2019

> I swear I'm gonna do it this time.

My solutions for AoC 2019 using Nim as my primary language.

I didn't finish AoC last year, that's why I swear I'll do it this time.
In reality I probably won't, but whatever.

I'll take this AoC as an opportunity to learn the wonders of Vim (or rather,
Neovim) and modal editing. Wish me luck.
